# Efficient Hamiltonisn Partitioning for Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)

### Description 

This project aimed to develop an partitioning scheme for a Hamiltonian that will able to be efficiently measured on a Quantum Computer. 
Currently I have included in this repository an excercise where I programmed a VQE algorithm for a 2-qubit Hamiltonian using Cirq which I used to familiarize myself with the workings of the VQE. 
The code for the efficient partitioning will be posted in the near future.

### Dependencies

* Cirq: https://quantumai.google/cirq
* Openfermion: https://quantumai.google/openfermion/install
* Numpy, Sympy, Matplotlib, random
