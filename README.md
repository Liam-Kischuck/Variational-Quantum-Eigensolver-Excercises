# Calculating the ground state energy of a 2-qubit Hamiltonian using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)

### Description 

For this excercise, I programmed a VQE algorithm for a 2-qubit Hamiltonian using Cirq, which I used to familiarize myself with the workings of the VQE. 
I did this as part of my undergraduate thesis project that aimed to develop a partitioning scheme for a Hamiltonian that will able to be efficiently measured on a Quantum Computer. 

#### Background 

The VQE is a quantum algorithm that can be used to calculate the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian. It was proposed as an algorithm that can be implemented on a Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) device, which are small to intermediate scale quantum computers.
